# Raspberry Pi Control Server

## English

Server that provides access to the Raspberry pi card via wifi. With this server you can easily control your raspberr pi card. You can customize the codes according to your request or according to your job. You can also make changes easily thanks to clearly written code.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

The master server and the raspberry pi card must have the "Socket" library installed. To download this library, simply enter the following code into the command line.

```
pip install socket
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
